The Thakur recruits Veeru and JaiFormer police chief Thakur Baldev Singh Sanjeev kumar summons an old colleague and requests him to track down a pair of small time thieves he once apprehended in the line of duty The two petty criminals Veeru Dharmendra and Jai Amitabh Bachchan are close pals who work together and share everything They had encountered the Thakur in the past as seen in a flashback when after being caught by him trying to rob a train he let them free temporarily to help him fight off bandits The three succeeded in doing so but as the Thakur lay unconscious after sustaining a wound Veeru and Jai disputed over leaving him for dead and escaping Veeru or letting him live but facing jail themselves Jai The call was decided over a coin toss which Jai won Recollecting that experience the Thakur explains that Veeru and Jai would be the ideal men to help him end the tyranny of Gabbar Singh Amzad khan an infamous dacoit bandit wanted by the authorities for a Rs 50 000 reward But money is not what the Thakur is after Veeru and Jai are found and brought to Ramgarh They are told by the Thakur that they are to bring Gabbar to him alive for Rs 20 000 plus the Rs 50 000 reward After some difficulty in trusting each other the Thakur demands Veeru and Jai s word and eventually Jai promises that they will do the job and he and Veeru decide to stay in Ramgarh to repel attacks from Gabbar s large gang The tyranny of GabbarThree of Gabbar s enforcers arrive in Ramgarh to collect supplies from the defenceless villagers This time however they go back empty handed due to Veeru and Jai s intervention The villagers show their gratitude by hailing their new heroes In Gabbar s camp the tyrant interrogates the three men he sent to Ramgarh about why they were defeated by only two men His psychotic nature is shown when he subjects his men to a twisted version of Russian Roulette where all three survive against the odds This event amuses Gabbar who begins to laugh uncontrollably at the bizarre occurrence and the unlikelyhood of it happening His cackles get louder and louder as his henchmen join in The three men who have survived this ordeal are bemused but then relieved and slowly begin to laugh as well As the sounds of all of Gabbar s army laughing like fools reverberate around the rocky camp Gabbar suddenly stops laughing and uses the three remaining bullets to shoot the three men dead Gabbar s plan to attack Ramgarh on Holi is put into action and in a much tougher battle this time Veeru and Jai meet their match and are held at gunpoint With his two recruits facing death the Thakur has a chance to throw a gun to Veeru But instead of helping he simply stands stationary With quick thinking Veeru and Jai manage to save their lives but at the end state their intentions to walk away from Ramgarh leaving the villagers to defend themselves due to the Thakur s cowardice But before they can the Thakur tells them the real reason of why he wants Gabbar and why he couldnt help them Some time ago the Thakur had caught Gabbar and had him imprisoned only for the dacoit to escape and plot an evil revenge against him Gabbar made his way to the Thakur s home and cold bloodedly killed his two sons daughter daughter in law and his only grandson The only person in the family to survive this massacre was the Thakur s younger daughter in law Radha Jaya Bhaduri The Thakur tracked down Gabbar but this time the tyrant held the upper hand thanks to his gang and tortured him Gabbar reminded the Thakur of his promise to come back and haunt him once he escaped and this was the day Grabbing two swords Gabbar maniacally approached the Thakur and ruthlessly amputated both his arms although the Thakur survives it The Thakur had shrouded this disability from Veeru and Jai but now it was clear why he could not physically help them Village lifeLiving in Ramgarh the cynical young Jai and lively Veeru find themselves growing fond of the villagers taking pity on their sufferings under dacoit tyranny Some of the villagers evoke more than fondness Veeru is attracted to Basanti Hema Malini a feisty talkative young woman who makes her living driving a horse cart However Basanti s aunt who thanks to Jai s meddling is reluctant to let Veeru marry her niece and only after Veeru takes drastic measures does she finally agree Jai is drawn to Radha the Thakur s reclusive widowed daughter in law who very subtly returns his affections The Thakur s servant Ramlaal tells of when Radha used to be full of life and colour until the day Gabbar killed her husband After discussing it with Radha s father the Thakur agrees that she can marry Jai The duo also befriend other villagers and instill a belief of freedom from Gabbar s villainous regime Among these are the blind imam and his son Ahmed who has been offered a job in the city but refuses to leave his father all alone He is eventually talked into going and sets off on his horse On the way he has the bad luck of running into Gabbar s henchmen Ahmed is killed and returned with a message for Ramgarh Hand over Veeru and Jai or suffer the same fate as the dead boy As the villagers stand over Ahmed s body they tell Veeru and Jai that they can give away whatever wealth they have but they cannot give away their children s lives The Thakur Veeru and Jai argue against ceding to Gabbar s threats but only the imam who has lost his son convinces the villagers that they cannot simply give in to evil The climaxVeeru and Jai fight back and send a message back to Gabbar For every villager killed by Gabbar Veeru and Jai will avenge them by killing four of his men in return Gabbar angered by this swears death on Jai Veeru the Thakur and all of Ramgarh The battle approaches its climax when Basanti and Veeru are captured and Jai follows As Basanti is forced to dance by Gabbar to keep Veeru alive Jai steadily gets through Gabbar s defences Soon Jai is able to get into a position to shoot Gabbar and demands the release of his friends Veeru and Basanti escape while Jai holds back the dacoits from a distance with a rifle Once Veeru and Basanti are safe Jai slowly draws back and heads for his friends only to be wounded grievously by a bullet as he is running away Jai is reunited with Veeru and Basanti where they realise they are running out of ammunition As Veeru is unaware of Jai s wound Jai orders him to go back to the village where he can take Basanti and then return with ammo Veeru does not want Jai to face the bandits alone so he suggests that Jai should go The two dispute once more and resort to what has been their only method of resolution over the years the coin As it was earlier in the film Veeru loses the toss and goes back to the village Jai slowly dying and with only a few bullets manages to fend off advances by the bandits who have hidden under a small bridge and have thrown a stick of dynamite that has failed to explode Jai manages to get close enough to the dynamite and uses his last bullet to detonate it taking out the bridge and most of Gabbar s men Veeru returns to find Jai dying and sadly talks with him before he dies in his arms Some of the villagers rush to the scene including Radha who once again must endure the anguish of losing someone As Veeru wipes a tear he notices Jai s old coin in his hand and then it dawns on him that he had been tricked by Jai all along The coin was double headed and Jai had managed to manipulate every situation that they disagreed on to his favour Angry at his friend for sacrificing his life to save him Veeru becomes hell bent on revenge and goes after Gabbar Veeru catches Gabbar and beats him up badly about to finish him off But before he can kill him the Thakur appears and reminds him of the promise to bring Gabbar to him alive Veeru is ready to break his word to avenge Jai when he is told that it was Jai who made the promise Unwilling to break Jai s promise Veeru hands Gabbar over to the Thakur who reveals his spike soled shoes made to make Gabbar beg for a quick death AftermathGabbar is kicked around by the Thakur but is saved in the nick of time by the police who tell the Thakur that Gabbar must be arrested and dealt with by the law As Gabbar is taken away the Thakur is denied vengeance but knows that Ramgarh is free once again Jai s funeral takes place as Veeru stands all alone in front of the pyre In the distance Radha watches on through a window With nothing more for him in Ramgarh Veeru leaves on a train But as he looks up he sees that he is not alone Basanti has also boarded the train and both she and Veeru leave Ramgarh together Plot In the small village of Ramgarh the retired policeman Thakur Baldev Singh Sanjeev Kumar summons a

Farhan Qureshi R Madhavan Raju Rastogi Sharman Joshi and Rancchoddas Rancho Shyamaldas Chanchad Aamir Khan are three engineering students who share a room in a hostel at the Imperial College of Engineering one of the best colleges in India While Farhan and Raju are average students from modest backgrounds Rancho is from a rich family Farhan wants to become a wildlife photographer but has joined engineering college to fulfil his father s wish Raju on the other hand wants to uplift his family fortunes Rancho is a wealthy genius who studies for the sheer joy of it However Rancho s passion is for knowledge and taking apart and building machines rather than the conventional obsession of the other students with exam ranks With his different approach Rancho incurs the wrath of dean of college Professor Viru Sahastrabudhhe ViruS Boman Irani Rancho irritates his lecturers by giving creative and unorthodox answers and confronts ViruS after fellow student Joy Lobo hangs himself in his dormitory room Joy had requested an extension on his major project on compassionate groundshis father had suffered a strokebut ViruS refused saying that he himself was completely unmoved by his own son s accidental death after being hit by a train Rancho denounces the rat race dog eat dog mindless rote learning mentality of the institution blaming it for Lobo s death Threatened by Rancho s talent and free spirit ViruS labels him an idiot and attempts on a number of occasions to destroy his friendship with Farhan and Raju warning them and their parents to steer clear of Rancho In contrast ViruS model student is Chatur Ramalingam or Silencer Omi Vaidya who sees a high rank at the prestigious college as his ticket to higher social status corporate power and therefore wealth Chatur conforms to the expectations of the system Rancho humiliates Chatur who is awarded the honour of making a speech at an award ceremony by substituting obscenities into the text which has been written by the librarian As expected Chatur mindlessly memorises the speech without noticing that anything is amiss partly aided by his lack of knowledge on Hindi His speech becomes the laughing stock of the audience infuriating the authorities in the process Meanwhile Rancho also falls in love with ViruS medical student daughter Pia Kareena Kapoor when he Raju and Farhan crash her sister s wedding banquet in order to get a free meal in the process further infuriating ViruS Meanwhile the three students continue to anger ViruS although Rancho continues to come first in every exam while Chatur is always second and Farhan and Raju are inevitably in the last two positions The tensions come to a head when the three friends who are already drunk break into ViruS s house at night to allow Rancho to propose to Pia and then urinate on a door inside the compound before running away when ViruS senses intruders The next day ViruS threatens to expel Raju lest he talks on the other two Unable to choose between betraying his friend or letting down his family Raju jumps out of the 3rd floor window and lands on a courtyard but after extensive care from Pia and his roommates awakes from a coma The experience has changed Farhan and Raju and they adopt Rancho s outlook Farhan decides to pursue his love of photography while Raju takes an unexpected approach for an interview for a corporate job He attends in plaster and a wheelchair and gives a series of non conformal and frank answers However ViruS is unsympathetic and vows to make the final exam as hard as possible so that Raju is unable to graduate Pia hears him and angrily confronts him and when ViruS gives the same ruthless reply he gives to his students she denounces him in the same way that Rancho did over the suicide of Lobo Pia reveals that Viru s son and her brother was not killed in an accident but committed suicide in front of a train and left a letter because ViruS had forced him to pursue a career in engineering over his love for literature ViruS always mentioned that he unsympathetically failed his son on the ICE entrance exams over and over to every new intake of ICE students After this Pia walks out on the family home and takes ViruS s spare keys with her She tells Rancho of the exam and he and Farhan break into ViruS s office and steals the exam and give it to Raju who with his new found attitude is unconcerned with the prospect of failing and refuses to cheat and throws the paper away However ViruS catches the trio and expels them on the spot However they earn a reprieve when Viru s pregnant elder daughter Mona Mona Singh goes into labour at the same time A heavy storm cuts all power and traffic and Pia is still in self imposed exile so she instructs Rancho to deliver the baby in the college common room via VOIP after Rancho restores power using car batteries and a power inverter that Rancho had dreamed up and ViruS had mocked Rancho then delivers the baby with the help of a cobbled together Vacuum extractor After the baby is apparently stillborn Rancho resuscitates it ViruS reconciles with Rancho and his friends and allows them to take their final exams and they graduate Rancho comes first and is awarded ViruS s pen which the professor had been keeping for decades before finding a brilliant enough student to gift it to Their story is framed as intermittent flashbacks from the present day ten years after Chatur vowed revenge on Rancho for embarrassing him at the speech night and promised to become more successful than Rancho a decade later Having lost contact with Rancho who disappeared during the graduation party and went into seclusion Raju and Farhan begin a journey to find him They are joined by Chatur now a wealthy and successful businessman who joins them brazenly confident that he has surpassed Rancho Chatur is also looking to seal a deal with a famous scientist and prospective business associate named Phunsukh Wangdu Chatur sees Wangdu who has hundreds of patents as his ticket to further social prestige When they find Rancho s house they walk into his father s funeral and find a completely different Rancho Jaaved Jaffrey After accusing the new man of stealing their friend s identity and profiting from his intellect the host pulls a gun on them but Farhan and Raju turn the tables by seizing the father s ashes and threatening to flush them down the toilet The householder capitulates and says that their friend was a destitute servant boy who loved learning while he the real Rancho was a lazy wealthy child who disliked study so the family agreed to let the servant boy study in Rancho s place instead of labouring In return the real Rancho would pocket the qualifications and the benefits thereof while the impersonator would sever all contact with the world and start a new life The real Rancho reveals that his impersonator is now a schoolteacher in Ladakh Raju and Farhan then find Pia and take her from her wedding day to Suhas by performing the same tricks with his material possessions and having Raju turn up to the ceremony disguised as the groom and eloping with Pia in public When they arrive in Ladakh they see a group of enthusiastic Ladakhi children who are motivated by love of knowledge Pia and the fake Rancho rekindle their love while Chatur mocks and abuses Rancho the schoolteacher before walking away When his friends ask what his real name is he reveals that it Phunsukh Wangdu and phones Chatur who has turned his back to turn around and meet his prospective business partner Chatur is horrified and falls to his knees accepts his defeat and continues to plead his case with Phunsukh to establish the business relationship he was after Plot edit edit edit This article s plot summary may be too long or

visit their son Murli They are extremely proud of their son who has fulfilled their expectations and become a doctor running his own hospital named the Hari Prasad Sharma Charitable Hospital or so they believe Murli had instead become the gangster Munnabhai but he cannot bear to shatter his parents dreams and so whenever they come to visit he sets up this medical masquerade he dresses up his building as the Hari Prasad Sharma Charitable Hospital and all his gang act as doctors or patients Therefore this occasion is no different everything is set up and everyone acts their part and with a few criminal interruptions everything goes smoothly Munna s parents have arrived this time for a purpose they wish to find a girl to marry their son While on a walk in a Mumbai park Hari Sharma bumps into an old friend Dr Asthana who used to work in their village but now works to the city The two exchange friendly words and talk about their children when Hari hears that Asthana s daughter is also a doctor he decides to have his son marry this girl Munna remembering that Asthana s daughter was his childhood pal Chinky attempts to meet her and explain everything unfortunately Dr Asthana discovers Murli s secret identity and angrily reveals it to Hari and Parvati insulting them as well Hari is particularly hard hit that his son lied to him he and his wife cut his visit short and leave for home That night Munna and Circuit sit sadly in front of their home Munna a little drunk resolves to truly fulfill his father s dream by becoming a doctor Circuit tells him to sleep the fiasco off

and pass an entrance examination with a mark above 90 Munna repays Dr Pavri for this helpful advice by kidnapping Dr Pavris Poppa and blackmailing him into assuming Munna s identity and taking the entrance examination Thus Munna passes the examination with flying colors and is joyfully is on his way to fulfilling his fathers dream M Bole To On Munna s first day at the Institute he immediately causes a stir He frightens a doctor into treating a young man who had attempted suicide the doctor had initially refused as the youth s mother hadnt filled out the necessary administrative forms his class mistakes him for their teacher he moves into a college room and takes it over completely he scares the senior students when they attempt to rag him and on top of that he discovers that the Institute s Dean is none other than Dr Asthana Later on though he meets Dr Suman who unbeknownst to him is his old friend Chinky As time progresses Munna s antics make him popular with his students He arranges with Circuit to bring an extra body to the Institute for dissection purposes a concept which fails as Circuit picks up a Chinese tourist and Munna himself is unable to dissect the body he meets the suicidal patient he saved earlier and cheers him up with a song he hugs a old bitter and underappreciated janitor cheering the fellow up significantly and he yells at a doctor for treating Anand Banerjee a comatose patient like a corpse and takes Anand into his own personal care Although these antics slowly endear Dr Suman to him they slowly drive her father mad as Dr Asthana places a great emphasis on his students to maintain a formal relationship with the patient he considers Munna a troublemaker and seeks to eject him He sets up the most difficult examination in the Institute s history to prove Munna unqualified and get rid of him which leads Munna to send Circuit to pay a visit to Dr Pavri s Poppa once again Having overcome that hurdle Munna tries to contact Chinky again This time Dr Asthana and Suman try a different method they send a moll to act as Chinky and to act in such a foul manner that Munna will be discouraged from marrying her and so discontinue the medical course The idea works Munna is no longer interested in Chinky but to Dr Asthana s chagrin he falls in love with Dr Suman Later Munna meets Dr Suman s patient Zaheer a depressed young man who has been diagnosed with stomach cancer Munna later sends Circuit with some girls to entertain Zaheer cheering him up significantly This is the last straw for Dr Asthana and he attempts to pass Munna off with a degree and get him out Although he had cheated before Munna refuses this backhand approach he eventually manages to stay on by throwing himself over a ledge and severely injuring himself thereby confining him to the Institute s hospital Later Poppa is admitted to the Institute where even his son is unable to save him but Munna and Circuit are able to bring life back into Poppa with a board game Munna is busy memorizing the answers for Dr Asthana s quiz kindly provided by Dr Pavri in gratitude for saving his father when Dr Suman brings distressing news Zaheer is in a terminal condition and wishes to see him With his last breath Zaheer begs Munna to save him eventually dying in Munnas arms The incident shakes Munna so much that he can t get through Dr Asthana s quiz Disgraced by Dr Asthana a second time he leaves the Institute Then the whole Institute is shaken as Anand Banerjee whom had been given up as a lost cause attempts to follow Munna and bring him back Encouraged by this Dr Suman publicly rebukes her father for chasing away a man who only tried to make the patients happier and more cheerful That night Munna and Circuit drown their sorrows in alcohol but when they reach home they find a surprise Munna s parents wait for them at their headquarters with open arms The Sharmas have been told of their son s exploits and Hari Prasad Sharma forgives his son everything

From time to time there comes a product that you have to sit up and take notice just because somebody even attempted it Madras Caf with all its flaws is one such movie Ours has been a nation obsessed with Gods and saviors Even more than the Jews we Indians have always been looking for a savior to rescue us from the mire that is our lives Our mythological stories are full of Gods to took human form to save mankind and our recent history is filled with people who are considered demi Gods by their supporters From Gandhi to Mamata our leaders always evoke one of two reactions total and unquestioned loyalty or complete and utter dismissal In such an environment Madras Caf tries to tell the story of arguably the most important political event of our times The assassination of Rajiv Gandhi without a doubt changed the face of Indian politics Shoojit Sarkar and John Abraham producer have to be commended for trying to tell an unbiased story on how Rajiv Gandhi came to be assassinated in a most gruesome manner The movie traces the story from the point of view of Bikram Singh a RAW agent who works undercover in Sri Lanka to undermine LTTE chief Prabhakaran and help get the peace process on track Along the way he is double crossed kidnapped lied to and loses the most cherished parts of his life Unfortunately John Abraham the actor does not live up to John Abraham the producer Johns limited acting abilities mean that we are left feeling cold and unattached to the main protagonist This is not the first time John has essayed a promising role in the most lifeless manner possible check out No Smoking or Shootout at Wadala The movie is filled with bad actors essaying promising roles or good actors essaying one dimensional roles For all the effort Shoojit Sarkar fails to recreate the magic of Vicky Donor He is let down by the script and the acting skills at his disposal But it is not all gloomy Instead there is a lot to recommend about the movie For one the photography is top class Shot mostly in Kerala and Tamil Nadu Kamaljeet Negi does a fine job of capturing the beauty and horror that must have been Sri Lanka in the Prabhakaran era The music by Shantanu Moitra is complementary without being intrusive to the storytelling Then there is the fact that this movie was actually made This is a moment when you have to put aside your demand for the perfect movie and watch Madras Caf just so you can tell Bollywood that youd prefer this brand of cinema to the Khans brand What John Abraham needs is to build a team of good technicians and actors If he can continue to support and make money from the kind of cinema he believes in it would be a turning point for Bollywood Verdict Must watch Plot edit edit edit The plot opens in Jaffna where a bus

Every now and again comes a film that shakes you A film that deeply affects you and the core purpose of the film goes beyond the realms of cinema as being just entertainment as the purpose then turns into education Yes the best of commercial directors ala Santoshi is able to merge commercialism with realism portraying the social message in a commercial format however on the other hand we have directors like Rahul Dholakia who take an event issue and portray it with utmost reality conviction without adding any commercial elements into the movie These movies are usually a bleak watch nonetheless prove to be a rewarding and eye opening experience and PARZANIA falls into the same category Rahul Dholakia brings to screen the Godhra riots and the aftermath of the riots Inspired by a true story the movie narrates the heart breaking story of a Parsi family living in a Muslim colony in the state of Gujarat The riots break out and the family lose their 10 year old son A simple story on paper by Dholakhia turns into one of the most hellish and horrific films Ive seen in recent times The screenplay by Dholakia and David Donihue starts off establishing the milieu of where the horror is about to take place as well as establishing the key players of the movie The build up to the actual riots is slow allowing enough time for the viewers to build a bond with the family Once the riots begin the movie takes a gripping and shocking turn which in many instances is a hard watch The pace does flounder a little in the second half however the movie still manages to retain the viewers interest as the viewers are given an insight into the scars left by such a tragedy First Mr Dholakia certainly deserves all the accolades he has been getting for his sheer courage in choosing to portray this extremely delicate flash point episode in Indias recent history Dholakia made his debut with the inane comedy KEHTA HAI DIL BAAR BAAR however after watching PARZANIA its evident that his forte lies in handling a complex and realistic film like PARZANIA The movie is constructed in three acts In the first the main characters are set up the happy family of Cyrus comprising himself his wife Shernaz daughter Dilshad and son Parzan the disillusioned American studying Gandhi and the rest of the residents of the Muslim dominated chawl including the sole Hindu family that lives in harmony with the others In the second act we see elements of brief consternation shown in the first act coming together and exploding into the pogrom that comes to wreck the lives of Cyrus and his family The third act is a soul searching exercise following the aftermath of the first violent 72 hours leading into the denouement of the NHRC hearing first the faked exonerating testimonies then the inevitable admission of guilt by a Hindu followed by a pouring forth of searing indictments The realism and barbaric brutality that happened in the riots have been shown with unflinching honest and Dhoalkia must be given full credit for NOT deviating from his core aim Now there is a section of people who will question WHY IS THE HINDUS SHOWN AS VILLAINS AND MUSLIMS IN A SYMPATHETIC LIGHT Frankly if youre questioning that after watching PARZANIA then youve missed the point It wouldnt have mattered whether Dholakia chose to portray the movie from the Hindu or Muslim point of view as while watching the movie I as a Hindu simply didnt care The movie goes beyond religion and in many ways questions the reasoning behind our beliefs Having the movie from a Parsi stand point is also a masterstroke as they are neither Hindu nor Muslim which adds to the blindness and fanaticism of such tragedies The third act though slow still manages to leave a hammer strong impact as it examines and studies the after math of the riots One of the most startlingly beautiful moments in the movie which again questions the reasoning behind our belief is when Sarika holds her daughter closely to her and prays to god On one hand our faith is what keeps us alive our faith is what confirms us our faith is what gives us hope and also gives us strength and at the same time all the violence and horror around her is being caused in the name of the same god Searingly beautiful The expose of the politics involved with the riots too is an eye opener right from the involvement of the police to the politicians truly a tragic state of affairs The court room scenes towards the end are excellent to say the least A film like PARZANIA will also evoke arguments discussions and also raise some excellent points for debates The film in many ways raises more questions than it answers and in my view for the better The biggest crime is that PARZANIA has been banned in the state of Gujarat The people of Gujarat need to see this movie as the movie is about for them The major nitpick I had with Dholakia was the inclusion of an American character in the movie The characters thoughts and ideals I found absolutely fantastic Corin Nemec as Allan gives a brilliant performance While it may have been done with the intent to appeal to an overseas audience and that can scarcely be blamed given our own reluctance to admit folly it deserved more treatment the Americans disturbed childhood believe me when I say however that it was not as disturbed and as tragic as I had been led to believe and as I have known of some others his introduction to Gandhi his impotent drunken rage and finally with a mere sob the disavowal of liquor and embrace of Gandhian values was somewhat hurried and jarring On another ironical level having a white outsider being prevalent when such an event occurs watching the nightmare unfold is insightfully strange to say the least There was a time when the whites were our enemy and here is a time when were our own worst enemy Dholakia himself a Parsi makes it no surprise that he is an ardent follower of Gandhis values and ideals The movie is laden with Gandhis famous quotes AN EYEFOR AN EYE AND THE WORLD GOES BLIND which was also used by Kashyaps BLACK FRIDAY The other slight problem I had with the movie was that the entire movie was in English for the most with some Gujarati and Hindi thrown in Once again I believe this is Dholakias way of appealing to a wider audience however in this case it does stand out in many ways for the worse as the dialogues dont sound natural in all places The film also has a HEAVY usage of expletives which makes OMKARA look like play school and words like fuck and ben chod are used frequently though I should add that they only add to the authenticity of the movie and are NOT there for gimmick purposes Next we come to what really made PARZANIA work the actors Naseeruddin Shahs portrayal as the patriarch and Sarikas role of the mother were two of the most compelling performances in recent times Nasseruddin Shahs has played a Parsi to perfection before in THE ENCOUNTER and BEING CYRUS yet he still manages to add another facet to the persona and in turn brings the character of Cyrus to life Shah brings so much warmth and sincerity to his everyday guy performance that when the riots to occur your heart cries out for him Given the stature and talent of Shah I actually found his performance in a first half a little subdued however he makes up for it in the second half The affected Cyrus when he goes on his 9 days of solace is simply startling and Shahs ability in portraying Cyruss unrest mind is amazing The scene in the cinema hall as the truth comes to him is just amazing and Shahs facial expressions will evoke a tear Undoubtedly one of Indias finest actors Shah strikes again with a performance that makes us sit up and take notice However it would be unfair to say the film is dominated by him as Sarika is equally if not more powerful here Sarikas performance is a stunning revelation Her Shernaz is a woman whose universe is snugly wrapped around her husband and her two bubbly kids and which is mercilessly shorn asunder when the rioting mob invades her chawl and burns it up Yet she displays phenomenal strength and resolve hiding her anguish in the innermost vestiges of her heart and only once sobbing uncontrollably and even then so as not to add to all that her daughter has been through locking herself in the bathroom The courtroom scene in the climax is yet another testament to Sarikas acting ability and she doesnt disappoint Parzan Dasturs Parzan is an innocent and unforgettable performance as the face of the young boy haunts you long after the final reels are over For those that dont remember this is the same little boy from Karan Johars KUCH KUCH HOTA HAI who had the famous lines to Kajol Tussi mat jao More than Dasturs Parzan it is Pear Barsiwalas Dilshad which impressed me most as the adorable young daughter who plays a foil to Parzan during the happy days then comes into her own when she escapes the clutches of the fanatics with her mother She successfully persuades Shernaz to stay with her instead of going to look for Parzan The shock is surely indelible but she displays unfathomable pluck in clinging to her innocence and childhood Colin Nemecs performance itself is praiseworthy and the actor does a fine job His out bursts at the India the politics and his thoughts on Gandhi make up for an interesting watch to say the least but as mentioned earlier the character at times sticks out Raj Zutsi Sheeba Chaddha Asif Basra are all superb in their respective parts This is Zutsis best performance in a long time Pushpendra Saini who plays the Gandhian in the movie is outstanding to say the least The movie features an array of supporting actors who play the residents policemen politicians etc and they are all spot on Technically the cameraman has tried to be as authentic as possible when capturing the movie on celluloid which works well here Sham Kaushals riot sequences are award worthy as mentioned earlier Zakir Hussains music too is masterful and soulfulPARZANIA is a far cry from the commercial cinema that Bollywood is for the most made up of and the scene where a huge poster of Karan Johars KABHIE KHUSHI KABHIE GHAM is burnt and tattered serves as a reminder that the world of PARZANIA is entirely different a must watch All up PARZANIA is highly recommend be prepared for an incredibly real and deeply impacting movie which makes us question WHY Plot edit edit edit Allan Corin Nemec an American arrives in Ahmedabad searching for answers to find internal peace and to understand the world and his troubled life He

respect slowly he becomes the kingpin of smuggling world in Mumbai He successfully divides the area among four gangsters peacefully thus pinning the police in the deck who were desperately in search of gangsters fighting with each other The film shows despite of black activities Sultan Mirza is a godfather like figure to the people He is basically a smuggler who has his own principles like he
